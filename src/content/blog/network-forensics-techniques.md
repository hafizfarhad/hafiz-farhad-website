# Advanced Network Forensics Techniques

Network forensics plays a crucial role in cybersecurity incident response, providing insights into attack vectors and helping organizations understand the scope of security breaches.

## Evidence Collection

### Packet Capture Analysis

Comprehensive packet capture provides the foundation for network forensics:

- Full packet capture vs. metadata collection
- Storage and retention considerations
- Legal and privacy implications

### Log Correlation

Effective forensics requires correlating data from multiple sources:

- Firewall logs
- DNS queries
- DHCP assignments
- Authentication events

## Analysis Techniques

### Timeline Reconstruction

Building accurate timelines of network events helps investigators understand attack progression and identify key indicators of compromise.

### Traffic Pattern Analysis

Analyzing network traffic patterns can reveal:

- Command and control communications
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Lateral movement activities
- Persistence mechanisms

## Tools and Technologies

Modern network forensics relies on specialized tools for data collection, analysis, and visualization. Open-source and commercial solutions each offer unique capabilities for different investigation scenarios.
