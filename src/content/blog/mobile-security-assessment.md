# Mobile Application Security Assessment Framework

Mobile applications have become integral to business operations, making their security assessment crucial for organizational risk management.

## Assessment Methodology

### Static Analysis

Static analysis involves examining the application code without executing it:

- Code review for common vulnerabilities
- Configuration analysis
- Third-party library assessment
- Data storage evaluation

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis tests the running application:

- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Network traffic analysis
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Data leakage detection

## Common Vulnerabilities

The most frequently encountered mobile security issues include:

- Insecure data storage
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Insufficient transport layer protection
- Client-side injection attacks

## Mitigation Strategies

Effective mobile security requires a multi-layered approach combining secure coding practices, proper configuration management, and ongoing security monitoring.
